# Introduction

SmartRecycle is an AI/ML-powered recycling bin that can sort and separate different types of recyclable materials, such as plastic, glass, metal, and paper, using linear rails to deposit them into the correct receptacle. The system utilizes a combination of computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify and classify different materials. The system then employs a movable caddy on the linear rails to transport them above the trash and drop them in by removing the bottom of the caddy. The project involves the integration of several hardware components, including cameras, sensors, motors, and microcontrollers, as well as the development of custom software to control and coordinate these components. The proposed Smart Recycle has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of recycling, reducing contamination and promoting sustainability.

# AI/ML

I used the Google Colab from EdjeElectronics to put TensorFlow Lite on my Raspberry Pi 3
